          All the devs at Bleitz only want to make a game that everybody wants to play.<br>No barriers. No limits. Everybody with everybody.<br>
          The only thing that we want from you is feedback and we can fix all your problems. We aren't your enemies we are your friends.<br><br>

          At the time, Spirekeeper is the only project from us. But in future we plan of becoming a big studio.
